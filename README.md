# Calculator_Class

Hello, My name is Joebeck Andrew F. Gusi from BSCPE 1-5.

This repository contains a Python program that uses the Tkinter library to create a calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI). 
Users can use the calculator program to do basic math calculations such addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:

- Addition: Enter two numbers and receive their sum.
- Subtraction: Enter two numbers and find the difference.
- Multiplication: Enter two numbers and receive their product.
- Division: Enter two numbers and calculate the result of dividing the first by the second. 
When dividing by zero occurs, the application shows an error notice.
- User-friendly interface: The program provides a simple and straightforward graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with.

Thank you and enjoy using my program.
